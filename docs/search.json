      "contents": "\nI graduated from UCSB in 2020 with a B.S. in Aquatic Biology. I spent much of my undergrad as a scientific diver and lab tech for SBC-LTER. I loved being underwater off my favorite coast everyday among the kelp forests collecting data as part of decades-long projects. I continued field work after I graduated, but this time in Wetland restoration. Both ecosystems alike many others are experiencing permanent damage caused by anthropogenic aources .\nI am privileged to have spent so much time in marine research and I believe it has given me an advantage in understand their importance. I came to Bren to learn more about people’s relationship with the environment, especially though the food they consume (e.g. fish, agriculture). I am also interested in how coastal cities will be responding to climate change and how we can better develop our cities to be more self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n",
