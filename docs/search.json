      "contents": "\nI graduated from UCSB in 2020 ith a B.S. in Aquatic Biology. I spent much of my undergrad as a scientific diver and lab tech for SBC-LTER. I loved being underwater off my favorite coast everday amongst the kelp forests collecting data as part of decades-long projects. I continued field work after I graduated, but this time in Wetland restoration. Both ecosystems alike many others are experiencing permant damage caused by anthropogenic stressors.\nI am privledged to have spent so much time in marine research and I believe it has given me an advantage in understand their importance. I came to Bren to learn more about people’s relationship with the environment, especially though the food they consume (e.g. fish, agriculture). I am also interested in how coastal cities will be responding to climate change and how we can better develop our cities to be more self-sustaining.\n\n\n\n",

Relationship between two species, S. etonia and S. repens and the following physical variables: length (cm), height (cm), width (cm) of canopy, and number of green leaves. Figure A indicates that the length of the canopy could potentially be a predictor in species, with the mean length in S. repens being slightly lower than that of S.etonia. Figures B and C are slightly less obvious predictors of species. The # of green leaves represented in figure D appear to be the most obvious predictor variable, with the # of green leaves being significantly lower in S. etonia compared to S. repens.\nBinary Logistic Regression\nBinary logistic regression is performed below on two different established models to determine probability of palmetto being a S. etonia or S. repens: Model 1 predictor variables include: green_lvs, height, width and length. Model 2 predictor variables include: green_lvs, height, and width.\n\n\\[\n\\scriptsize\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log\\left[ \\frac { \\widehat{P( \\operatorname{species} = \\operatorname{1} )} }{ 1 - \\widehat{P( \\operatorname{species} = \\operatorname{1} )} } \\right] &= 3.23 - 1.91(\\operatorname{green\\_lvs}) - 0.03(\\operatorname{height}) + 0.05(\\operatorname{length}) + 0.04(\\operatorname{width})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log\\left[ \\frac { \\widehat{P( \\operatorname{species} = \\operatorname{1} )} }{ 1 - \\widehat{P( \\operatorname{species} = \\operatorname{1} )} } \\right] &= 3.77 - 1.88(\\operatorname{green\\_lvs}) + 0(\\operatorname{height}) + 0.07(\\operatorname{width})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.
