 I graduated from UCSB in 2020 with a B.S. in Aquatic Biology. I spent much of my undergrad as a scientific diver and lab tech for SBC-LTER. I loved being underwater off my favorite coast everyday among the kelp forests collecting data as part of decades-long projects. I continued field work after I graduated, but this time in Wetland restoration. Both ecosystems alike many others are experiencing permanent damage caused by anthropogenic aources . 
  
  I am privileged to have spent so much time in marine research and I believe it has given me an advantage in understand their importance. I came to Bren to learn more about people's relationship with the environment, especially though the food they consume (e.g. fish, agriculture). I am also interested in how coastal cities will be responding to climate change and how we can better develop our cities to be more self-sustaining.
